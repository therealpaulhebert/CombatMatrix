# CombatMatrix
A JavaFX based program built with Scene Builder to help GM's and players track their turns in combat. The program takes an initiative roll and the number of attacks and attempts to spread these across the chart. This was built with the Rifts RPG in mind, but could be used for any Palladium RPG.
